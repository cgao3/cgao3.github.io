Welcome to my homepage. My name is Chao Gao.  I obtained my PhD degree from the [Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta](http://cs.ualberta.ca), co-supervised by [Prof. Martin Mueller](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~mmueller/) and [Prof. Ryan Hayward](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~hayward/). 

Research
======

I have a wide interest in various aspects of Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research, with a particular focus on techniques that are able to solve real-world challenging problems.  
See [Projects](/projects/) for more about the projects I have worked on and am currently working on.

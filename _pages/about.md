I am currently a staff researcher/engineer and team lead at Huawei Canada Research Center in Edmonton. 
I obtained my PhD degree from the [Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta](http://cs.ualberta.ca), 
advised by [Prof. Martin Mueller](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~mmueller/) and [Prof. Ryan Hayward](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~hayward/). 

Research
======

I am interested in various aspects of artificial intelligence. 
My current research focus is mainly **application-driven**. 
Our current work are centered at using AI/ML algorithms for hardware/software optimization. 
See [Projects](/projects/) for more about the projects I have worked on and am currently working on.

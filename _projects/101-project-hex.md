See [here](/files/WhyHex) for a brief description for the game of Hex.

Playing and solving are two major themes in empirical AI methods for computer games. 
The [AlphaGo](#) by [DeepMind](#) has sparked a series of subsequet successes of deploying deep neural networks to various games, including the game of Hex. Despite the impact their new algorithm has brought to **games AI**, researchers are natural to wonder what is the next major algorithmic direction for games, and what games are mostly appropriate for this dedication. I advocate that [Game of Hex be considered by post-AlphaGo/Zero AI research](/files/why_hex.pdf)
